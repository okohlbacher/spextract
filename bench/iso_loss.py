"""Which collapses cost peptides, and which were free?

Pre-extraction isotope collapse cut dataset D emission 927,813 -> 691,144 (the reference implementation: 700,434) and 15% of
runtime, but lost 1,659 of 12,537 Sage peptides. That average is useless for deciding what to keep:
the question is whether the harmful removals are a distinguishable CATEGORY.

Method, entirely on existing output, no assumption about the rule that was applied:
  * a baseline precursor coordinate absent from the collapsed output was REMOVED (coordinates are
    bit-identical -- the collapse runs after inference, on the same list)
  * every removed precursor is assigned its SURVIVOR: the nearest kept precursor on the isotope
    lattice (same charge, co-eluting, co-mobile)
  * each removal is then classed by what it cost:
      dark      the removed spectrum was never identified            -> free
      covered   its peptide is still identified somewhere else       -> free
      LOST      its peptide is gone from the collapsed result        -> harmful
Then the three classes are compared on every feature available at collapse time, which is the only
way to get a rule that could be applied without knowing the answer.
