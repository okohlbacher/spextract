# Is our emission inflated by M+1/M+2 precursors, and can those spectra be merged?

**Hypothesis (user, 2026-09-03).** We emit 927,813 pseudo-spectra on dataset D where the reference implementation emits
700,434. Two claims to test: (a) the excess comes from selecting M+1/M+2 as precursors in their own
right instead of the monoisotope; (b) those spectra are basically identical and could be merged.

**Verdict: (a) confirmed and large. (b) refuted -- they are not near-duplicates, and no ordering rule
can collapse them without losing a quarter of the peptides.** The lever is upstream, at precursor
selection, and the mechanism is now named.

Scripts: `bench/iso_dup.py` (emission-level census + identification join), `bench/iso_collapse.py`
(collapse-rule evaluation), `bench/iso_sim.py` (content similarity). All run on the shipping arm
output `d7_apex/pseudo.mzML` (apex estimator, `require_isotope_support`), no re-extraction.

## 1. The duplication is real, and it is the whole of the excess

A spectrum counts as a duplicate if another EMITTED spectrum sits k isotope steps below it
(k = 1..3) at the same charge, within 3 s in RT and 0.02 in 1/K0. Both tolerances are at least as
tight as the extractor's own isotope-partner gate (`gate:delta_rt` 3.0 s,
`charge:iso_im_tolerance` 0.05), so every pair counted here was reachable by the extractor and was
not linked. The decoy offset is the same step plus 0.5/z -- same magnitude, off the isotope lattice --
because at 10^6 spectra in a narrow m/z range, lattice coincidences happen by chance.

| offset | spectra with a partner below | % of emission |
|---|---|---|
| isotope k*1.00335/z | 291,657 | 31.4% |
| decoy +0.5/z | 35,114 | 3.8% |
| **excess (real)** | **256,543** | **27.7%** |

Steps: k=1 177,689; k=2 62,795; k=3 51,173. Removing every heavier member leaves **671,270 spectra,
4% BELOW the reference implementation's 700,434.** The inflation is isotope-offset duplication, essentially in full.

## 2. They are NOT near-duplicates in content

Binned sqrt-intensity cosine on 1,500 sampled pairs of each kind:

| pair type | median cosine | p25 | p75 | > 0.9 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| isotope-linked | 0.505 | 0.316 | 0.721 | 6.5% |
| co-eluting neighbour, off-lattice | 0.446 | 0.250 | 0.686 | 6.3% |
| random spectra | 0.022 | 0.011 | 0.036 | 0.0% |

Being one isotope step apart adds almost nothing to content similarity over an arbitrary co-eluting
neighbour (0.505 vs 0.446); both sit far above random only because co-eluting spectra in one window
draw from the same fragment pool. **Only 6.5% are near-identical.** Each precursor hypothesis runs
its own fragment correlation and selects a different subset, so these are different extractions under
different mass labels, not one extraction emitted twice.

## 3. Collapsing loses peptides under every rule, and the naive rule is backwards

Identification join, Sage 1% spectrum-FDR, 291,657 isotope-linked pairs:

| | pairs | % |
|---|---|---|
| neither identified | 234,768 | 80.5% |
| both, same peptide (genuinely redundant) | 23,570 | 8.1% |
| **only the HEAVY one identified** | **20,966** | **7.2%** |
| only the light one identified | 11,389 | 3.9% |
| both, different peptides | 964 | 0.3% |

Dropping every heavy member loses **3,797 of 14,944 peptides (25%)**. Collapsing connected components
of the isotope graph (73,558 multi-member groups covering 445,917 spectra) to one member each:

| rule | spectra kept | peptides kept | lost |
|---|---|---|---|
| keep lightest (the naive rule) | 555,454 (59.9%) | 9,771 | 5,173 |
| keep most isotope partners | 555,454 | 9,933 | 5,011 |
| keep richest spectrum | 555,454 | 9,880 | 5,064 |
| **oracle (keep whichever was identified)** | 555,454 | 13,557 | **1,387** |

Even the oracle loses 1,387: single-linkage chains span genuinely different species. This reproduces
the earlier blanket falsification of `merge:rt_window` and `consolidate:delta_rt` and explains it.

**And "keep the lightest" is backwards.** Sage's own isotope correction on the identified member
(offset 0 = the mass we reported was right):

| | offset -1 | 0 | +1 | +2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| heavy-only identified | 4,904 | **14,624 (70%)** | 1,193 | 245 |
| light-only identified | 6,236 | 4,458 (39%) | 454 | 241 |

When only the heavy member is identified, 70% of the time the mass WE reported for it was correct --
the heavier member is the true monoisotope and its lighter partner is the spurious one. Even among
light-only identifications, 55% needed a -1 correction, i.e. that mass was also below the true mono.
Our monoisotope assignment errs systematically TOO LIGHT, consistent with the documented 22.9%
wrong-mono rate and with `findPartner` matching m/z, RT and IM but never intensity.

## 4. Mechanism: a consumed peak is invisible, so the leftover seeds its own precursor

`findPartner` skips any peak already marked `used[]` (src/spextractor.cpp:1129). When an earlier
seed consumes a run, a remaining peak one step up can no longer walk left to it, finds nothing, and
becomes its own monoisotope. The signature is visible in the emitted metadata: heavy members carry
systematically FEWER isotope partners than their light partners (`spx_n_isotopes` mean 3.53 vs 4.59;
34.0% of heavy members are at the minimum of 2 against 13.9% of light members). Group sizes run to
9+ members, the chain such sequential consumption produces.

## 5. What follows

The excess is not redundancy to be merged away downstream; it is over-generation to be prevented
upstream, and every downstream collapse tested costs more peptides than it saves spectra. That
matches the standing finding that only a precursor quality gate can reach the reference implementation's count, and it
sharpens it: the gate must be an OWNERSHIP rule, not an m/z ordering rule.

**Pre-registered next experiment (not yet run).** Replace the `used[]` boolean with owner tracking:
when a new seed's isotope-lattice neighbour at the same charge is already owned by an emitted
precursor, suppress the new precursor instead of letting it become a fresh monoisotope. A/B on dataset D,
both engines, plus entrapment. Prediction: emission falls toward ~670-700k with peptides within
replicate noise. Falsifier: peptides fall by more than the 0.17% replicate spread -- which the 7.2%
heavy-only-identified population makes a real risk, since suppression discards exactly the member
that is right 70% of the time. If it fires, the correct form is REPLACEMENT (transfer ownership to
the better-fitting member), not suppression.

## 6. Implemented: collapse the precursors before extraction

`SPEXTRACTOR_ISO_COLLAPSE=intense|light|heavy|niso` (with `SPEXTRACTOR_ISO_COLLAPSE_K`, default 3) runs
after the isotope-support gate and before the window loop, so the duplicate hypotheses never reach
extraction and their extraction cost is saved as well.

**Structure: a greedy dominating set, NOT single linkage.** Precursors are visited best-first by the
rule; each survivor removes the co-eluting, co-mobile, same-charge hypotheses sitting 1..K isotope
steps to either side of it, and an already-kept precursor is never removed. Transitive chaining is
what made the offline component collapse lose 1,387 peptides even with an oracle (chains span
genuinely different species), so each removal is one hop from a surviving member.

**Default rule is MS1 trace intensity, and the direction matters.** The measured failure is
symmetric: sometimes we seed on a spurious peak below the true mono, sometimes on a leftover above a
consumed run. Intensity is right in both cases, because a spurious peak below the mono is weaker and
the mono outweighs its own M+1 below about 1800 Da. Above that the rule inverts, which is why `light`
runs as a control rather than as an assumption.

**Pre-registered A/B (dataset D, queued behind the dataset A/dataset B confirmation chain):** arms `intense` K=3,
`light` K=3, `intense` K=1. Both engines; entrapment on the default arm, since a large emission cut
changes the FDR denominator. Success = emission near 670-700k with Sage and MSFragger peptides within
the 0.17% replicate spread and entrapment no worse than the shipping arm's 1.37%. Falsifier = peptides
fall outside that spread, which would mean the duplicate hypotheses were carrying real content that
the survivor's own extraction does not recover -- and would close the emission question for good.

## 7. A/B result: the collapse works mechanically and costs peptides at every setting

| dataset D arm | precursors removed | spectra | Sage @1% | MSFragger @1% | wall |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| apex baseline | -- | 927,813 | 12,537 | 11,927 | 15:21 |
| **intense, K=1** | 166,440 | 786,300 (−15.3%) | **11,965 (−4.6%)** | **11,546 (−3.2%)** | 14:22 |
| intense, K=3 | 285,410 | 691,144 (−25.5%) | 11,036 (−12.0%) | 10,667 (−10.6%) | 13:07 |
| light, K=3 | 299,588 | 679,241 (−26.8%) | 10,728 (−14.4%) | 10,446 (−12.4%) | 13:01 |

Entrapment on the K=3 arm is 1.32% against the shipping arm's 1.28%, so nothing here is an FDR
artefact. Two things are settled. **The intensity rule beats the naive lightest rule** (11,036 vs
10,728), as the identification evidence predicted. **And the trade is continuous, not a cliff:** each
1% of emission removed costs 0.30% of peptides at K=1, 0.47% at K=3 and 0.54% under the light rule --
the marginal cost RISES as more is cut, so there is no plateau to stop on.

## 8. Where the damage is: 2.1% of removals, and they are not duplicates at all

Every removal traced back to what it cost (`bench/iso_loss.py`, spectrum-level FDR, so totals differ
slightly from the peptide-level table above):

| class | removals | share | cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| dark -- the removed spectrum was never identified | 205,386 | 86.8% | none |
| covered -- its peptide is still identified elsewhere | 26,217 | 11.1% | none |
| **LOST -- its peptide is gone** | **5,066** | **2.1%** | **2,139 peptides** |

**97.9% of the collapse is free.** The harm is 5,066 removals, and those peptides were fragile before
anything was collapsed: median ONE identifying spectrum against four for retained peptides, 52.6%
with exactly one. For 97.4% of lost peptides the collapse took every spectrum that carried them, and
exactly ONE retained peptide was re-found on a surviving spectrum. The survivor does not inherit the
removed member's identification -- the cosine result, confirmed at the identification level.

**The isotope step separates safe from unsafe:**
| step | removals | harm rate | peptides at risk | covered/dark |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 121,535 | **1.31%** | 1,032 | 18.5% |
| 2 | 46,906 | 3.99% | 792 | 9.3% |
| 3 | 31,142 | 3.32% | 469 | 6.9% |
One step is three times safer per removal, buys the most spectra, and carries by far the highest share
of genuinely redundant removals -- which is exactly what the K=1 arm confirmed. Steps 2 and 3 are
where the greedy rule over-reaches: one intense precursor wipes out genuinely different species up to
3 Da away.

**What the harmful class actually is.** Not duplicates: faint peptides that co-elute and co-migrate
within one isotope spacing of an abundant neighbour, i.e. lattice coincidences. The survivor is
identified in 63.1% of `covered` removals but only 5.0% of `LOST` ones. So the operative question at
collapse time is not "which member is the monoisotope" but **"are these two the same species at all"**,
and two hypotheses of one peptide share that peptide's elution profile while an independent faint
neighbour does not. The decision log now records the MS1 XIC Pearson correlation between the removed
precursor and its survivor so the harm rate can be measured against it and a threshold set from data.

## 9. No collapse-time feature separates the harmful removals -- except charge

The decision log carries everything the extractor knew when it decided. Harm rate against each,
over 285,410 logged removals (dark 200,131, covered 25,860, LOST 4,989, unemitted 54,430):

**MS1 elution correlation FAILS, and fails backwards.** Harm rises with correlation, 0.99% for an
undefined profile to 3.06% at corr >= 0.95, and the covered:LOST ratio is flat at ~5.3 across every
bin. The hypothesis that co-eluting profiles mark true duplicates is wrong: everything within the
3 s gate co-elutes, so correlation measures gate width, not identity. Intensity ratio is no better
(harm 0.95-2.25%, no monotone trend).

**Charge separates cleanly, by a factor of 28:**
| subset | removals | dark | LOST | harm% | peptides at risk | dark per peptide risked |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| all (K<=3) | 285,410 | 200,131 | 4,989 | 1.75% | 2,016 | 99 |
| **charge 1** | 98,452 | 59,124 | **108** | **0.11%** | 53 | **1,116** |
| charge 2 | 127,646 | 99,230 | 3,987 | 3.12% | 1,536 | 65 |
| charge 3 | 51,249 | 35,535 | 856 | 1.67% | 374 | 95 |
| charge 4 | 7,016 | 5,322 | 36 | 0.51% | 29 | 184 |
Secondary, weaker: removing the HEAVIER member is 2.8x safer than removing the lighter (0.75% vs
2.07%), and a removed peak whose own envelope is LONGER than a tail member's would be is safe to
remove (0.38%). Neither approaches charge.

## 10. The real lever is not collapse at all: singly-charged precursors

Charge 1 removals are nearly free because **the entire z=1 population is nearly free**:
| z | emitted spectra | share | identified spectra | rate | peptides ONLY at this charge |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | **271,559** | **29.3%** | 1,136 | **0.42%** | **259 (1.73%)** |
| 2 | 400,590 | 43.2% | 61,338 | 15.3% | 8,507 (56.9%) |
| 3 | 197,985 | 21.3% | 37,718 | 19.1% | 3,963 (26.5%) |
| 4 | 38,495 | 4.1% | 2,619 | 6.8% | 328 (2.2%) |
| 5 | 19,184 | 2.1% | 79 | 0.4% | 9 (0.1%) |

A z=1 pseudo-spectrum is identified 36x less often than a z=2 one. Tryptic peptides are essentially
never singly charged in ESI, and `charge:scoring count` breaks ties toward the LOW charge, so this is
where the mis-assignments land. **Dropping z=1 outright is -29.3% emission for -1.73% peptides**, and
lands at 656,254 spectra, below the reference implementation's 700,434 -- against -15.3% emission for -4.6% peptides at
the best collapse setting. Five times the efficiency, and one line of code instead of a graph
algorithm.

`SPEXTRACTOR_MIN_CHARGE=z` implemented. **Pre-registered arm (running):** z>=2, z>=2 with the k=1
collapse, and z>=3, on dataset D with both engines and entrapment. Prediction: z>=2 loses under 2% of Sage
peptides, and may GAIN, since removing 29% of never-identified spectra also removes their share of
the multiple-testing burden. Falsifier: peptides fall more than the 1.73% the offline join predicts,
which would mean the z=1 spectra contribute identifications indirectly through FDR calibration.

## 11. Result: the charge gate wins, the collapse loses, and they do not combine

| dataset D arm | spectra | Sage @1% | MSFragger @1% | wall | entrapment |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| apex baseline | 927,813 | 12,537 | 11,927 | 15:21 | 1.28% [1.03-1.53] |
| **z >= 2** | **656,254 (−29.3%)** | **12,642 (+0.8%)** | **12,073 (+1.2%)** | **12:48 (−17%)** | 1.38% [1.15-1.64] |
| z >= 2 + collapse K=1 | 541,356 (−41.7%) | 12,067 (−3.8%) | 11,623 (−2.5%) | 11:39 | 1.24% [1.01-1.51] |
| z >= 3 | 255,664 (−72.4%) | 5,088 (−59%) | 5,060 (−58%) | 08:48 | 0.96% [0.66-1.35] |

**`z >= 2` gains peptides on both engines while cutting emission by 29.3% and runtime by 17%,** and
lands below the reference implementation's spectrum count. The set is near-superset: 310 peptides gained, 205 lost. The
multiple-testing prediction was right -- 271,559 spectra identified 0.42% of the time were not merely
useless, they were costing identifications by inflating the search space. z >= 3 confirms the gate is
not a monotone knob: charge 2 carries 56.9% of peptides, and removing it is catastrophic.

**The isotope collapse does not survive the charge gate.** Applying K=1 on top turns +0.8% into −3.8%
on Sage and +1.2% into −2.5% on MSFragger. Once the singly-charged junk is gone, every further
lattice removal is taken out of real signal. This closes the collapse line: **the collapse stays OFF
in every form** (K=1, K=3, intensity rule, lightest rule, with or without the charge gate).

**Caution before adoption.** Entrapment moves 1.28% -> 1.38%, at the pre-registered 1.4% bound. The
intervals overlap heavily so this is not yet a difference, but dataset A and dataset B must confirm it.
**Confirmation arm running:** z >= 2 on dataset A and dataset B, both engines, entrapment against the same apex
baselines. Adopt as default only if peptides do not fall on either engine on either file and
entrapment stays within the apex interval; a rise past 1.4% on a second file means the gate is buying
peptides with false positives and must be reconsidered as an option rather than a default.
